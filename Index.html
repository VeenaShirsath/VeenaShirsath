                <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">I am a first year student at the MS in Economics and Computation 
                    program of Duke University. I hold a bacheloers degree in Economics from Ahmedabad University. <br><br>
                    I am passionate about environment, energy and urbanization and their intersection with development and wellbeing. 
                    My intersts lie in energy transitions, grid interactivity and energy policy. I have been engaged in community-level 
                    initiatives since high school and strongly believe in local-level and community-led solutions for building social 
                    and climate resilience. <br><br>
                    Before finding my interest in climate change and energy, I have explored urbanization, socio-economic development, 
                    and urban migration through resrach projects an internships.

                        <p><i>August 2023 - December 2023</i></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implemented an exponential distribution-based scheduling algorithm and linux-like scheduling alogrithm in 
                                Xinu Operating System. The goal was to understand the working of scheduling algorithms and their impact on 
                                system performance and efficiency. Exponential distribution-based scheduling algorithm helps in evaluating 
                                how different task arrival rates and execution times affect the system's performance. Whereas, Linux-like
                                scheduling algorithm helps to gain insights into traditional process scheduling techniques used in modern 
                                operating systems. This involved replicating features such as priority-based scheduling and round-robin. 
                                Along with this, context switching and process creation were also implemented to ensure the complete 
                                functionality of the scheduling algorithms.
                            </li>
                            <li>Developed a 2-level paging mechanism for memory virtualization in Xinu OS. This involved creating a page 
                                table structure to map virtual addresses to physical addresses, enabling efficient memory management and 
                                allocation. The implementation included features such as page table creation, page table lookup, and page 
                                replacement algorithms to ensure optimal memory utilization and system performance. Also implemented a 
                                system for using disk-based storage as backing storage when RAM is exhausted. This allows for extended 
                                virtual memory space and better management of memory resources. Created a page fault handler to manage 
                                memory access errors by retrieving pages from backing storage when they are not present in RAM. This mechanism
                                ensures smooth operation and recovery from page faults, maintaining system stability and performance.

                            <li>Build a disk reorganization mechanism testing ability to scan and reorganize disk blocks to optimize data 
                                storage and access. This involved creating a disk structure with multiple blocks and implementing a disk 
                                reorganization algorithm to rearrange blocks based on access patterns. The goal was to reorganize the disk so 
                                that the files start from the beginning of the disk and are stored contiguously in increasing order of
                                inode number. Managed disk storage that utilized a three-levl indirect data block mechanism to store file data.
                                This required implementing mechanism to handle complex file system and efficiently retrieve and mange disk blocks.

                        <p><i>July 2022 - April 2023</i></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developed a robust backend system using Flask to automate various aspects of the interview process.
                                This system streamlined candidate assessment by conducting interview, evaluating responses, asking follow-up
                                questions and providing feedback. The backend was designed to handle multiple users and interviews simultaneously,
                                ensuring efficient and reliable performance. Implemented a RESTful API to facilitate communication between the
                                frontend and backend, enabling seamless data transfer and interaction between the components.
                            </li>
                            <li>Implemented a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model using Python's NLTK library to analyze candidate responses
                                and to select appropriate follow-up questions. The model was trained on a dataset of interview questions and 
                                responses to identify patterns and generate relevant questions based on the candidate's answers. This involved 
                                preprocessing the text data, tokenizing and tagging words, and training the model to recognize context and intent
                                in the responses. The NLP model was integrated with the backend system to automate the interview process and 
                                provide personalized feedback to candidates. This enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of the assessment process,
                                enabling better candidate evaluation and selection.
                            </li>
                            <li>Conducted a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of the developed backend and recommendation systems. The 
                                findings were published at the PCEMS 2023 conference, where the research was presented to industry experts and 
                                academics. The paper detailed the system's architecture, performance metrics.

                        <p><i>January 2021 - April 2021</i></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developed a comprehensive Library Management System in C to efficiently manage and track library resources and 
                                member activities. These system is like a DataBase Management System which can be used to store, retrieve and 
                                manage data related to library resources and members. The system was designed independently using various data 
                                structures like Arrays, Linked Lists and B-Trees.
                            </li>
                            <li>The information stored in the system included book details, book location, member details along with information 
                                of their borrowed books, and fine details. 
                            </li>
                            <li>System supported various operations like adding new books, deleting books, searching books, borrowing books, 
                                returning books, adding new members and calculating fines. This was single threaded system which can be used to 
                                perform one operation at a time.

                        <p><i>July 2021 - November 2021</i></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developed a basic bash shell programmin C to uderstand fundamental concepts of command execution and process 
                                management in a Unix-like environment.The shell is designed to support single command execution, sequential 
                                command execution and parallel command execution along with the directory navigation and redirection 
                                commands. The goal was to create a simple, interactive shell that could execute basic commands and manage 
                                processes efficiently. Utilized a 2D array of string to parse and manage command inputs provided by the users. 
                                This approach facilitated effective handling of complex command structures and arguments.
                            </li>
                            <li>Implemented a concurrent web server on a template code in C to handle multiple client requests simultaneously. 
                                Implementation involved functionality to process incoming HTTP requests and generate appropriate responses. 
                                The server was incorporated with two scheduling policies, First In First Out (FIFO) and Shortest File First (SFF),
                                to manage the request queue and prioritize file delivery. Server was designed as multi-threaded using mutex 
                                locks and condition variables to handle concurrent requests and avoid race conditions. Also implemented a buffer
                                to store incoming requests and manage their processing efficiently.
