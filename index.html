      <summary>About Me</summary>
      <p>
        I'm a graduate student in Duke's MS in Economics and Computation program, where I focus on applying quantitative, 
        statistical, and machine learning methods to complex energy‑system challenges. My interest in the energy sector 
        began with my undergraduate thesis on demand flexibility using interval data, which sparked a broader commitment 
        to energy transition and energy equity.            
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience spans utility billing, interval, spatial, and climate datasets; econometric modeling; predictive 
        modeling; and energy systems analysis. I have worked on projects involving solar adoption and load‑shedding behavior, 
        automated pipelines for interval‑data insights, and simple residential battery storage optimization. I have also 
        explored energy‑storage modeling for residential solar systems and am actively building deeper expertise in power 
        systems optimization and modeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about using rigorous, data‑driven methods to support grid modernization, clean energy access, 
        storage and flexibility solutions, and equitable energy systems. I am seeking full‑time roles in energy analytics, 
        power systems modeling, market development, or energy and climate policy, where I can apply my technical training 
        and interdisciplinary perspective to accelerate the energy transition.
