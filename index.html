                <summary>About Me</summary>
                <p>
                    I'm a graduate student in Duke's MS in Economics and Computation program, where I focus on applying quantitative, 
                    statistical, and machine learning methods to real‑world energy challenges. My interest in the energy sector began 
                    with my undergraduate thesis on demand flexibility using interval data, which sparked a broader commitment to energy 
                    transition and energy equity work.
                    
                    My experience spans utility billing, interval, spatial, and climate data; econometric modeling; predictive modeling; 
                    and energy systems analysis. I've worked on projects ranging from modeling solar adoption and load shedding, to 
                    building automated pipelines for interval data insights, to storage optimization and financial analysis for energy 
                    projects. 
                    
                    I'm passionate about using data‑driven approaches to support clean energy access, grid modernization, storage and 
                    flexibility solutions and equitable energy systems. I'm actively seeking full‑time opportunities in energy analytics, 
                    market development, or energy and climate policy, where I can apply my technical training and interdisciplinary 
                    perspective to help accelerate the energy transition.
