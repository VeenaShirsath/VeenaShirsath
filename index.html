            <section id="about">
                <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">I am a second year student in the MS in Economics and Computation 
                    program of Duke University. I hold a bachelors degree in Economics from Ahmedabad University. I am passionate about climate and energy,
                    and their intersection with development, urbanization and wellbeing. 
                    My general interests lie in climate-related risk, energy transition, circular economy, and adaptation and mitigation finance/policy.
                    My research focuses on smart grids, energy access, and supporting clean energy transitions in emerging economies. I have worked on projects 
                    analyzing utility data for effective demand-side management, residential cooling demand  and, load characteristics. I am interested in 
                    applying quantitative tools and interdisciplinary collaboration to advance sustainable and equitable energy solutions. 
                    Before finding my interest in climate change and energy, I explored urbanization, socio-economic development, 
                    and urban migration through several research projects and internships.
