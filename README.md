## Hi there 👋

- I am a grad student at Duke University in the MS Economics and Computation program
- I’m currently working on predicting appliance use based on total housheold sub-hourly load
- I am interested in climate-related risk, energy transition, circular economy, and adaptation and mitigation finance/policy

Repositories include:
* linear optimization for power systems
* Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Models
* Causal methods in ML
* Spatial Analysis in Python
* Explorations in Deep Learning methods: Object detection and image classification
* Explorations in ML methods
